                    I have some JS experience, but weirdly, i missed all the introductory lessons and went right to things like APIs and set intervals, so it was nice to actually learn the fundamentals. I never learned how to properly write a function and call it. I used
                    to always set it to run on DOM load explicitly.
                    <br> <br>I made a radio station with my friend for fun (inspired by gossipscafe) so i decided to add ours here! I found some weird streaming thing and another odd library for the JS. Its really nice to have a communal experience, we
                    each tune in randomly throughout the day and its fun to call her and see that shes listening to it at the same time.
                    <br> I was also thinking about showing a random post on a button click... I might add it...
                    <br> I also think having a clock and changing to night mode etc is cute but I wanna try implementing some more complex stuff!

                    The media query refresher made me think of lukas eigler-harding's (i think it was him?) design of the rhizome net art anthology page is impossible to print (@media print). I think its a super creative way of harnessing these rules to create even more
                    personality to webpages, if that makes sense.

                    Watching the CSS video was interesting to me because they brought up the concept of rules that are dictated by the browser. I struggle with editorial design because it seems like you're starting fresh, I find it much easier to design for the web because
                    there's always a jumping off point, because certain elements have implied rules. I didn't realize that was the reason I was struggling with editorial design, so seeing that there was a logic to it was fun to recognize. (also, the dynamic
                    aspect of the web is a part of it. A book can only have one size, but a website can take many different forms)
